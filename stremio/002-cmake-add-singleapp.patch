Subject: Add CompatibleSingleApp sources to CMake build
Upstream: No (custom patch for Wolfi/Debian packaging)
Origin: https://salsa.debian.org/mendezr/stremio
Author: Juan Manuel MÃ©ndez Rey <vejeta@gmail.com>

This patch adds the CompatibleSingleApp implementation files to the
CMakeLists.txt build configuration. CompatibleSingleApp is a custom
Qt single-instance implementation that replaces the upstream
SingleApplication dependency.

The CompatibleSingleApp implementation is added as an embedded source
in a separate pipeline step before this patch is applied.
